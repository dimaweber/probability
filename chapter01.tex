\chapter{Probability Models}\label{chap:probability_models}
\minitoc
This chapter introduces the basic concept of the entire course, namely, probability. We discuss why probability was introduced as a scientific concept and how it has been formalized mathematically in terms of a probability model. Following this we develop some of the basic mathematical results associated with the probability model.
