This chapter introduces the basic concept of the entire course,\linebreak[2] namely, probability. We discuss why probability was introduced as a scientific concept and how it has been formalized mathematically in terms of a probability model. Following this we develop some of the basic mathematical results associated with the probability model.

\section{Continuity of $P$}
Suppose $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is a sequence of events that are getting ``closer'' (in some sense) to another event, $A$. Then we might expect that the probabilities $P(A_1), P(A_2), \ldots$ are getting closer to $P(A)$, i.e., that $lim_{n\to\inf}P(A_n)=P(A)$. But can we be sure about this?

Properties like this, which say that $P(A_n)$ is close to $P(A)$ whenever $A_n$ is ``close'' to $A$, are called \term{continuity properties}. The above question can thus be translated, roughly, as asking whether or not probability measures $P$ are ``continuous''. It turns out that $P$ is indeed continuous in some sense.

Specifically, let us write $\{A_n\} \nearrow A$ and say that the sequence $\{A_n\}$ \emph{increases} to $A$, if $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq A_3 \subseteq \cdots$, and also $\bigcup^{\inf}_{n=1} A_n=A$. That is, the sequence of events in an \emph{increasing} sequence, and furthermore its union is equal to $A$. For example, if $A_n=(1/n,n]$, then $A_1 \subseteq A_2\subseteq\cdots$ and $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\inf}A_n=(0,\inf)$. Hence, ${(1/n,n]}\nearrow(0,\inf)$. \autoref{fig:161} depicts an increasing sequence of subsets.

Similarly, let us write $\{A_n\}\searrow A$ and say that the sequence $\{A_n\}$ \emph{decreases} to $A$, if $A_1\supseteq A_2\supseteq A_3 \supseteq\cdots$, and also $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\inf}A_n=A$. That is, the sequence of events is a \emph{decreasing} sequence, and furthermore its intersection is equal to $A$. For example, if $A_n=(-1/n,1/n]$, then $A_1\supseteq A_2 \supseteq \cdots$ and $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\inf}A_n=\{0\}$. Hence, $\{(-1/n,1/n]\}\searrow\{0\}$. \autoref{fig:162} depicts a decreasing sequence of subsets.

We will consider such sequences of sets at several points in the text. For this we need the following result.
\begin{theorem}
    Let $A,A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be events, and suppose that either $\{A_n\}\nearrow A$ or $\{A_n\}\searrow A$. Then
    $$
    \lim_{n\to\inf}P(A_n)=P(A)\,.
    $$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    See \autoref{ch2:adv_proofs} for the proof of this theorem.
