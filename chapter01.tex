This chapter introduces the basic concept of the entire course,\linebreak[2] namely, probability. We discuss why probability was introduced as a scientific concept and how it has been formalized mathematically in terms of a probability model. Following this we develop some of the basic mathematical results associated with the probability model.

\section{Continuity of $P$}
Suppose $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ is a sequence of events that are getting ``closer'' (in some sense) to another event, $A$. Then we might expect that the probabilities $P(A_1), P(A_2), \ldots$ are getting closer to $P(A)$, i.e., that $\lim_{n\to\infty}P(A_n)=P(A)$. But can we be sure about this?

Properties like this, which say that $P(A_n)$ is close to $P(A)$ whenever $A_n$ is ``close'' to $A$, are called \term{continuity properties}. The above question can thus be translated, roughly, as asking whether or not probability measures $P$ are ``continuous''. It turns out that $P$ is indeed continuous in some sense.

Specifically, let us write $\{A_n\} \nearrow A$ and say that the sequence $\{A_n\}$ \emph{increases} to $A$, if $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq A_3 \subseteq \cdots$, and also $\bigcup^{\inf}_{n=1} A_n=A$. That is, the sequence of events in an \emph{increasing} sequence, and furthermore its union is equal to $A$. For example, if $A_n=(1/n,n]$, then $A_1 \subseteq A_2\subseteq\cdots$ and $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\inf}A_n=(0,\inf)$. Hence, ${(1/n,n]}\nearrow(0,\inf)$. \autoref{fig:161} depicts an increasing sequence of subsets.

Similarly, let us write $\{A_n\}\searrow A$ and say that the sequence $\{A_n\}$ \emph{decreases} to $A$, if $A_1\supseteq A_2\supseteq A_3 \supseteq\cdots$, and also $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\inf}A_n=A$. That is, the sequence of events is a \emph{decreasing} sequence, and furthermore its intersection is equal to $A$. For example, if $A_n=(-1/n,1/n]$, then $A_1\supseteq A_2 \supseteq \cdots$ and $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\inf}A_n=\{0\}$. Hence, $\{(-1/n,1/n]\}\searrow\{0\}$. \autoref{fig:162} depicts a decreasing sequence of subsets.

We will consider such sequences of sets at several points in the text. For this we need the following result.
\begin{theorem}
    Let $A,A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be events, and suppose that either $\{A_n\}\nearrow A$ or $\{A_n\}\searrow A$. Then
    $$
    \lim_{n\to\infty}P(A_n)=P(A)\,.
    $$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    See \autoref{ch2:adv_proofs} for the proof of this theorem.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
    Suppose $S$ is the set of all positive integers, with $P(s)=2^{-s}$ for all $s\in S$. Then what is $P(\{5,6,7,8,\ldots\})$?

    We begin by noting that the events $A_n=\{5,6,7,8,\ldots,n\}$ increase to $A=\{5,6,7,8,\ldots\}$, i.e., $\{A_n\} \nearrow A$. Hence, using continuity of
    probabilities, we must have
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            P(\{5,6 ,7,8,\ldots\}) & = \lim_{n\to\infty}P(\{5,6,7,8,\ldots,n\}) \\
                             & = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left( P(5)+P(6)+ \cdots + P(n)\right) \\
                             & = \lim_{nsty}\left( 2^{-5}+2^{-6}+\cdots+2^{-n}\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{2^{-5}-2^{-n-1}}{1-2^{-1}}\right) \\
                             & = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(2^{-4}-2^{-n}\right)=2^{-4}=1/16\,.
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Alternatively, we could use countable additivity directly, to conclude that
    $$
    P(\{5,6,7,8,\ldots\})=P(5)+P(6)+P(7)+\cdots\,,
    $$
    which amounts to the same thing.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let $P$ be \emph{some} probability measure on the space $S=R^1$. Suppose
    $$
    P((3,\,5+1/n))\geqslant\delta
$$
for all $n$, where $\delta>0$. Let $A_n=(3,\,5+1/n)$. Then $\{A_n\}\searrow A$ where $A=(3,\,5]$. Hence, we must have $P(A)=P((3,\,5])\geqslant\delta$ as well.

Note, howewer, that we could still have $P((3,\,5))=0$. For example, perhaps $P(\{5\})=\delta$, but $P((3,\,5))=0$.
\end{example}

\begin{summary}
    \item If $\{A_n\}\nearrow A$ or $\{A_n\}\searrow A$, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}P(A_n)=P(A)$.
    \item This allows us to compare or bound various probabilities that otherwise could not be understood.
\end{summary}

\begin{exercises}
    \item Suppose that $S=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ is the set of all positive integers that $P(\{s\})=2^{-s}$ for all $s\in S$. Compute $P(A)$ where $A=\{2,4,6,\ldots\}$ is the set of all \emph{even} positive integers. Do this in two ways -- by using continuity of $P$ (together with finite additivity) and by using countable additivity.6

            \item Must we have $P([0, 1/2]) \leqslant1/3$ ?
        \end{enumerate}
